CONTROLS (MORE DETAILED INFO UNDER "USAGE" BELOW)
--------------------------------------------------------------

---- Controller 1 ----

Select - toggle tile writing (auto-glitch)
Start - bankswitch
Up, Down, Left, Right - toggle movement in that direction
B - slows down everything (kind of)
A - speeds up everything (pretty much)

---- Controller 2 ----

Select - toggle background color cycling
Start - PAUSE (when held down)
Left, Right - not used
Up, Down - change screens and banks
B - tap tempo to control auto-glitch
A - turns off tile writing (auto-glitch) / clears tap tempo

USAGE
--------------------------------------------------------------

glitchNES is an NES ROM image. It will work in Nestopia (see above)
and other NES emulators. It has also been tested on NTSC NES hardware
using both EEPROM development carts and the RetroZone PowerPak.

The controls for 0.2 are very different. Most of them are toggles,
to make it easier to use glitchNES when performing live.

Summary of controller 1 stuff: Select toggles the tile writing routine,
which glitches the screen and scrambles the graphics. Start bankswitches
the CHR / graphics data, but keeps the current nametable loaded. The
arrow keys toggle movement in each direction. B and A slow down and
speed up everything, including the scrolling, tile writing, and the
color flashing on controller 2.

Summary of controller 2 stuff: Select toggles the background color
cycling, which can also scramble the screen depending on the current
speed. Start pauses everything, but only while held down. Left and right
are not used. Up and down changes both the nametable (screen) and the
CHR / graphics bank. B is the tap tempo button. Tap in time to sync
the tile writing routine to the beat. It can also be used for longer
on / off tile writing. If held for 4 beats, it then continue to toggle
the tile writing on and off for 4 beats until you hit the A button,
which turns off the tile writing and clears the tap tempo settings.

All of this can be changed, of course, by editing the source code.
I recommend Context with the 6502 highlighter for easy source code
manipulation. Even easier than editing the source code is changing
the tilesets.

You can use YY-CHR or a tile editor of your choice to edit the NES
ROM image once compiled. Replacing the tiles in the ROM will completely
alter the graphics, but the program will remain the same.

There are two included .NAM files, which are nametables. order.nam is
used for all screens, except for the 8bitpeoples logo. order.nam simply
orders all of the CHR data on the screen four times, as you can see if
you compare the CHR pages to displayed screens inside of glitchNES.
icon.nam places the entire CHR page in the middle of the screen, as you
see on the 8bitpeoples screen. This is good for logos.

If this CHR/NAM stuff confuses you, please download galleryNES and logoNES
from my site, and take a look at the included tools and readme files. It
is very easy to take your .NAM and .CHR files from those tools and use
them with glitchNES. Scroll to the bottom of the source code, and you can
see where the palette and .NAM file for each screen are loaded. Each palette
and .NAM corresponds to one page of CHR data, in order. There are two
example palette files included: pal0.pal and 8bp.pal. pal0.pal is the same
as palettes 1-6, but is included as a binary file to show that external
files can be loaded. 8bp.pal is used just for the final 8bitpeoples logo.
You can used .pal files and hex data entered in at the bottom
interchangeably.

Enjoy!
